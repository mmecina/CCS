Features which are on the ToDo list:

    * Executing the code of steps - CCS editor integration
    * Code reuse feature - database of codeblocks or steps - should have a very high usability -> full text search
    * Executing steps/code as own processes - make it possible to run them parallel or stop them
    * Use of Requirement/Verification IDs
