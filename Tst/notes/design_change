The requirement to execute steps parallel led to the consideration to implement the parallel tasks as a GTK application.
A test is still a sequence of steps which are executed one after another. This steps are run within a GTK application.
Parallel steps will be a separate test and also implemented as GTK application.
The first test will invoke the second one.
The design of a test as GTK application gives the benefit to use the Signal-feature.
This will it make possible to catch events or progress and thus control the flow of a test.
The communication between both applications is done via DBus.
Together with Signals it will be possible to create test scenarios where two or more parallel task can be executed and moreover the execution of steps be timed.
