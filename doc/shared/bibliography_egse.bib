abstract="Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) is the digital counterpart of conventional laser speckle velocitmetry (LSV) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. In this novel, two-dimensional technique, digitally recorded video images are analyzed computationally, removing both the photographic and opto-mechanical processing steps inherent to PIV and LSV. The directional ambiguity generally associated with PIV and LSV is resolved by implementing local spatial cross-correlations between two sequential single-exposed particle images. The images are recorded at video rate (30 Hz or slower) which currently limits the application of the technique to low speed flows until digital, high resolution video systems with higher framing rates become more economically feasible. Sequential imaging makes it possible to study unsteady phenomena like the temporal evolution of a vortex ring described in this paper. The spatial velocity measurements are compared with data obtained by direct measurement of the separation of individual particle pairs. Recovered velocity data are used to compute the spatial and temporal vorticity distribution and the circulation of the vortex ring.",

abstract = {The problem of optically estimating an object's position by using a charge-coupled device (CCD) array composed of square pixels $\Delta$x on a side is analyzed. The object's image spot at the CCD is assumed to have a Gaussian intensity profile with a 1/e point at a radial distance of 2$\sigma$s from the peak, and the CCD noise is modeled as Poisson-distributed, dark-current shot noise. A two-dimensional Cram\'{e}r--Rao bound is developed and used to determine a lower limit for the mean-squared error of any unbiased position estimator, and the maximum-likelihood estimator is also derived. For the one-dimensional position-estimation problem the lower bound is shown to be minimum for a pixel-to-image size ratio $\Delta$x/$\sigma$s of between 1 and 2 over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. Similarly for the two-dimensional problem, the optimum ratio is shown to lie between 1.5 and 2.5. As is customary in direct detection systems, it is also observed that the lower bound is a function of both the signal power and noise power separately and not just of their ratio. Finally, the maximum-likelihood estimator is shown to be independent of the signal and noise powers at high signal-to-noise ratios.},

abstract="Sorting is the basic problem of computer science. After the introduction of four bubble sorting algorithm: traditional, marked flag, two-way bubble and alternate, the time and space complexity of these algorithms were summarized. They are all   O(n2) and  O(1). The performances of these algorithms were verified by programming. The result was that non-traditional sorting algorithms were time cost-less than traditional when the random degree of input sequence was low, otherwise the traditional was time cost-less. The experiment shows three approximate relationships. One is four algorithms' time cost and input scale could be characterized by an exponential curve. The second is the traditional algorithm's time cost and random degree could be described by a horizontal line. The last is the non-traditional algorithms' time cost and random degree could be depicted by a line with the slope of 40{\textordmasculine}.",
