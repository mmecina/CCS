# If using a venv that has not been initialised with the --system-site-packages option, you can try to install gi and dbus in the venv directly, or via vext
# vext
# vext.gi
# vext.dbus
# vext requires python-gobject dbus-python to be installed on system level.
# Alternatively, install pygobject with pip (requires gobject-introspection to be installed)

# If using Conda for managing Python packages, vext might not work. Try installing PyGObject in the venv with Conda instead:
# conda install -c conda-forge pygobject

# For TASTE, which also needs libdbus-1-dev, gir1.2-notify-0.7, libgirepository1.0-dev, libgtk-3-dev:
# pygobject
# dbus-python
